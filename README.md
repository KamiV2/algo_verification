# Proof of Randomized Linking by Rank for Jayanti-Tarjan Union Find

This repository contains a TLAPS proof of an invariant which proves the linearizability of a randomized linking-by-rank Jayanti-Tarjan concurrent union find algorithm, using the metaconfiguration tracking technique of [Jayanti et al.](https://doi.org/10.1145/3632924).
